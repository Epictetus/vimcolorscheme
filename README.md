This is a Ruby DSL for creating Vim color schemes. I personally found color
schemes difficult to get working in both terminal and graphical interfaces, this
DSL tries to remedy that by, for example, automatically filling in the value of
guibg by looking at ctermbg.

# Installation

Installation is standard for a Ruby gem:

    gem install vimcolorscheme
